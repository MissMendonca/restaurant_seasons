Seasons Restaurant


My name is Liovirgilda Mendonca, and for this user-centric project, I have decided to build a restaurant website 
since I have been working in the restaurant business for over a year.

UX


From a user point of view, this website allows them to:
    
    i. View the menu online, so they have the opportunity to know what the restaurant offers beforehand;
    ii. Make an online booking, so they guarantee they will have a table at their chosen time;
    iii. View a list of upcoming events taking place at the restaurant so they can book tickets in advance;
    iv. Get to know the history of the restaurant and their main members;
    v. Get in touch with the restaurant, so they can receive extra information given by a member of the staff.

Features


The menu.html page has:
    
    Bootstrap collapse cards to show the restaurant menu.

The drinks.html has:
    
    An image that when is clicked opens the drink menu pdf. 
          
The index.html page has:
    
    i- A Bootstrap warning div - informing the customers of upcoming events;
    ii- A bootstrap slide - showing the next three artists performing at the restaurant;
    iii- An iframe Booking system - that allows a user to book a table.

    !!! Attention!!! 

    I have not created the iframe Booking system present on my website. 
    The OpenTable iframe was taken from "Dinner by Heston Blumenthal" website!


The events.html page has:
    
    Bootstrap cards to display information about the date of the event as well as the Artist's name and picture.

The aboutus.html page uses:
    
    Bootstrap Grid system to provide historical information about the restaurant and the staff.
    
The contactus.html page allows a user to get in contact with the restaurant by displaying:
    
    i. A Bootstrap Contact Form filled with placeholders to help the user fill up the form; 
    ii. The restaurant address;
    iii. A Bootstrap Warning div with the restaurant opening times and contact number.

Last but not least...

    I could not have done the Seasons Food Menu without the help of my fantastic friend 
        - the Chef Christophe Laurent.
    
    He made this menu with so much love and caring, and I will always be grateful for his contribution.
